Bacterial species that live in the human belly button may have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Samples from volunteers across the country have been tested to determine what bacteria their belly button contains. This project created a webpage that houses interactive charts to explore the dataset, by ID number, to determine the bacteria found in each subject.
